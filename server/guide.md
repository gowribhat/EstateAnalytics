# Guide for Adding Components to the Server Directory

This guide explains how to add new components to the server directory and update the necessary files to integrate them into the application.

## Steps to Add a New Component

1. **Create the Component Script**
   - Add a new `.R` file in the appropriate subdirectory under `server/components/`.
   - Follow the existing structure and naming conventions for consistency.
   - Include a detailed explanation of the component's purpose and key functionalities at the beginning of the file.

2. **Define Reactive Values and Observers**
   - If the component requires reactive values, define them in the `server.R` file or within the component script.
   - Use `observeEvent` or `reactive` functions to handle user interactions and data updates.

3. **Update the Main Server File**
   - Open `server/server.R`.
   - Add the new component script to the list of dynamically sourced files:
     ```r
     component_files <- list.files("server/components", pattern = "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
     lapply(component_files, function(file) source(file, local = TRUE))
     ```
   - Ensure the new component script is placed in the correct directory so it is automatically sourced.

4. **Test the Component**
   - Run the application and test the new component to ensure it works as expected.
   - Check for errors or warnings in the R console and address them.

5. **Document the Component**
   - Add comments and documentation within the script to explain its functionality.
   - Update this guide if the component introduces new patterns or dependencies.

## Best Practices

- **Modularization**: Keep components self-contained and focused on a single functionality.
- **Error Handling**: Use `tryCatch` or similar mechanisms to handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Consistency**: Follow the coding style and conventions used in the existing components.
- **Collaboration**: Communicate with team members when adding components that affect shared functionality.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure that new components are seamlessly integrated into the application.

Now, go make the necessary changes in the UI, js, and css for rendering.
