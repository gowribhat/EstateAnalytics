## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**

    Run script to install any missing packages for local developement.

    ```r
    source("scripts/install_packages.R")
    ```

1.  **Run the Shiny app**

    Click on the ‚ÄúRun App‚Äù button in Rstudio to start the Shiny app.

## Deployment Files

Ensure that the following files are included when deploying the app:

- `app.R` ‚Äì Main Shiny app file
- `global.R` ‚Äì Shared libraries and configurations
- `server/` ‚Äì Folder with server-side logic
- `ui.R` ‚Äì UI layout file

## üöÄ GitHub Workflow Guide

### üîÅ BEFORE You Start Working

Always make sure your branch is up-to-date before making changes.

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Switch to `master`:
   - Click **"Current Branch"** ‚Üí select `master`.
   - Click **"Fetch Origin"** and **"Pull"** to get the latest version.
3. Switch to **your feature branch** (or create one if new).
4. Click **"Branch > Merge into current branch"**.
5. Select `master` and click **"Merge"**.

   ‚úÖ Your feature branch is now updated with the latest `master`.

### üõ†Ô∏è While Working on Your Feature

1. Open your editor (**RStudio** or **VSCode**).
2. Make your changes locally.
3. **Commit frequently**:
   - Save your changes.
   - Go to **GitHub Desktop**.
   - Write a **short commit message** describing what you have done in this commit (e.g., `"Added proximity filter for schools"`).
   - Click **"Commit to `<your-branch>`"**.
4. Push your work:
   - Click **"Push origin"** to upload your branch changes to GitHub.

> üí° Tip: Small, regular commits make it easier to review and fix issues.

### ‚úÖ When You Finish a Feature

1. Push all your latest changes (see step above).
2. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and open the project.
3. Click on **"Pull Requests" > "New Pull Request"**.
4. Set:
   - **Base branch** ‚Üí `master`
   - **Compare branch** ‚Üí your feature branch
5. Add a short summary and **click "Create Pull Request"**.
6. Tag a teammate for review (or ping on group chat).
7. Once approved, click **"Merge"** to merge your work into `master`.

### üîÅ After Merging or When Others Merge to Master

To stay up-to-date:

1. Pull the latest `master` (see "Before You Start Working" section).
2. Merge it into your own branch if you're still working on other features.

### üîë Summary: What Everyone Should Always Do

- **Start your day by updating `master` and your branch**
- **Work on your own branch**
- **Commit frequently and push your changes**
- **Open a PR when your feature is ready**
- **Merge your PR only after review**
- **Update your local project regularly**

## ü§ñ Optional: AI-Powered Setup (VS Code + GitHub Copilot + Ollama)

Want to boost your workflow with **AI assistance**? Set up **free AI tools** to help write, understand, and debug code for the project.

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Install Visual Studio Code

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download and install VS Code for your system.
3. Open the project folder:
   - Launch VS Code
   - Go to **File > Open Folder**
   - Select the project directory of cloned repo

### üéì 2. Get GitHub Student Pack (Free Copilot Access) <a name="student-pack"></a>

1. Visit: [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
2. Click **‚ÄúGet Student Benefits‚Äù** / **Sign in for Student Developer Pack**
3. Sign in with your GitHub account using your NUS email
4. Follow the verification steps

> ‚è≥ Approval can take 1‚Äì2 days, but gives you:
>
> - ‚úÖ Free GitHub Copilot
> - ‚úÖ Free Codespaces
> - ‚úÖ More dev tools (free!)

### ü§ñ 3. Enable GitHub Copilot in VS Code

Once your student access is approved:

1. Open **VS Code**
2. Go to the **Extensions tab** on the left (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for `GitHub Copilot` and `Github Copilot Chat` and click **Install**
4. Sign in with your GitHub account
5. Start coding ‚Äî Copilot will suggest lines and functions as you type! Copilot chat allows you to ask question and edit files automatically by selecting the context files.

### üí¨ 4. Use GitHub Copilot Chat in Your Browser instead of VS Code

After your [student pack from step 2](#student-pack) is approved:

1. Open any file in your GitHub repository (like `ui.R`, `server.R`, etc.)
2. Click on the **Copilot Chat** icon (search for logo if unsure) in the **top-right corner**
3. Type a question in natural language, such as:
   - `"Explain what this R function does"`
   - `"How can I fix this error in my code?"`
   - `"Suggest improvements for this filter logic"`
   - `"What does leafletOutput() do in Shiny?"`
4. You can also go to [https://github.com/copilot/](https://github.com/copilot/) on you browser to start a chat and add the project repository or specific files as attachments.
